NeoScrypt CUDAminer
=======

NeoScrypt only. All other algorithms have been removed.

Doesn't depend on OpenSSL and Zlib any more. Only the cURL library
required (also pthreadVC2 and NVAPI on Windows).

To be compiled with GCC v4.7+ on Linux and Visual Studio 2010
(or vs2010 target in newer Visual Studio distributions) on Windows XP
and up the way, 32-bit and 64-bit.

Supports the NVIDIA Maxwell and Pascal architecture GPUs only.
