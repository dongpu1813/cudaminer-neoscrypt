In order to build this NeoScrypt CUDAminer on Windows, you need the following:

1) the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 6.5 or newer installed;

2) Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, express or any commercial, though a newer one
may do as long as it's supported by the CUDA Toolkit;

3) any not so old NVAPI distribution (copy headers to compat/nvapi and nvapi.lib
to compat/lib32 or compat/lib64 or both);

4) the cURL library from https://curl.haxx.se (copy headers to compat/curl and
curl.lib to compat/lib32 or compat/lib64 or both);

5) the pthreadVC2 library from http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32
(copy pthread.h and sched.h to compat/pthreads and pthreadVC2.lib to
compat/lib32 or compat/lib64 or both).
